As I look through my current setup it occurs to me that I have no idea how the
hell it works.

I set it up a couple years ago and now I'm not even sure where the homepage html
lives.

For now I'm going to try to consolidate everything I have so it can all live in
this repo, and after that is when I'll do new work
