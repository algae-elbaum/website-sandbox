# website-sandbox

My personal website! algaelbaum.me

Sandbox as in a playground.

Homepage with basic information. Side pages with whatever dumb projects I end
up doing since right now I feel I'm stagnating.

Plan to rebuild now in Django. Not for any practical reason; I just feel like
I'd like to keep somewhat in practice with it. Plus I suppose if I ever want to
do more complex things it'll be nice to already have the infrastructure in
place.
