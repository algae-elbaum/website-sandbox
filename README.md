My personal website! algaelbaum.me

Homepage with basic information. Side pages with whatever dumb projects I end
up doing since right now I feel I'm stagnating.

Plan to rebuild now in Django. Not for any practical reason; I just feel like
I'd like to keep somewhat in practice with it. Plus I suppose if I ever want to
do more complex things it'll be nice to already have the infrastructure in
place.

Currently, the html directory is my site. I just moved /var/www/html/ into the
repo, cleaned up a bit, and made a symlink so apache (I think it's apache?)
can't tell the difference. The next step is setting up django and migrating
this stuff to it. After that I can think about making it work nice and doing
new things
